System can be configured to query nodes for latest version of a file regularly.
Proper configuration (synchronizing before writing to a file) should prevent most conflicts.

In case of conflict, it is presented to the user to fix. (this can only arise when file is being edited and some other node send updated version).
Only nodes which have all conflicts resolved can present it's file version.

Eventual consistency guaranteed - all nodes will have the same history eventually.
